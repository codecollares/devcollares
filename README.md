# Portfolio - Collacritty

This is where I host my portfolio as a software developer.

There I put my contact info, personal projects, soft and hard skills and a little about me!

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
## 
  **PS:** there's a hidden command on the terminal and the command is my favorite Eeveelution. .w.

  *Also, the name Collacritty was inspired on the famous Linux terminal called Allacritty.*
